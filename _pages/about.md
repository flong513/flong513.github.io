Hello! I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/), studying [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yiyue Luo](https://yyueluo.com/) in the [Wearable Intelligence Lab](https://yyueluo.com/group). My research sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing for Healthcare, and Applied Machine Learning, with the goal of engineering technologies that help people *live*, *heal*, and *learn* better. Recently, I have been exploring sensor array designs for electrical impedance tomography to enable real-time, continuous monitoring of muscle activity.

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I currently serve as a Teaching Assistant for EE 201 and have previously TA’ed EE 271.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis, running, taking long exploratory walks, and experimenting with new recipes. Feel free to reach out—I'm always happy to connect and chat!
